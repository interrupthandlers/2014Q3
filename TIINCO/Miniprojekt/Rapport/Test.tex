\chapter{Test}
The functions \code{EncodeCyclicSystematic()} and \code{decodeSingleStep()} have been tested separately to ensure that they return the expected output when given a specified input. The input and output values have been taken from the material presented in \emph{Lecture 7} \cite{lec7}.

The entire Meggitt decoder application has been tested by using the GUI. By using different combinations of one and two errors in the error vector, it has been verified that the decoder can correct up to two errors.
\\Tests have also been done with three errors where it has been confirmed that the decoder introduces errors to the decoded message vector. Thereby the error-correcting capability of the code has been verified to two errors.
