\chapter{Test}
The functions \code{EncodeCyclicSystematic()} and \code{decodeSingleStep()} have been tested separately to ensure that they return the expected output when given a specified input. The input and output values have been taken from the material presented in \emph{Lecture 7} \cite{lec7}.

The entire Meggitt decoder application has been tested by using the GUI described in chapter \ref{cha:gui}. By using different combinations of error vectors with one and two errors, it has been verified that the decoder can correct up to two errors.
\\Tests have also been done with three errors where it has been confirmed that the decoder introduces errors to the decoded message vector. Thereby the error-correcting capability of the code is limited to two errors.
