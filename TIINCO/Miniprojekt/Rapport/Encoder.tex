\chapter{Encoder}
An encoder has the task of transforming the message vector into the codeword. In this project the following additional requirements apply to the encoder function:

\begin{itemize}
\item The function has two inputs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Generator polynomial
	\item Message vector
	\end{itemize}
\item The function has one output
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Code vector
	\end{itemize}
\item The code vector must be in systematic form
\end{itemize} 

\section{Cyclic codes in systematic form}
\label{sec:cyclicCodeInSystematicForm}
This section explains the theory of constructing cyclic codes in systematic form and is based on \emph{Essentials of Error Control Coding}\cite{essentials} section 3.4

The regular procedure for constructing cyclic codewords is to multiply the message polynomial $m(X)$ with the generator polynomial $g(X)$ to obtain the codeword $c(X)$. However this encoding process produces non-systematic codewords, which are not preferable when implementing a decoder in hardware. Therefore the systematic encoding procedure is introduced.

Given a message polynomial of the form:

{\centering 
$m(X) = m_0 + m_1X + ... + m_{k-1}X^{k-1}$ \par}

the systematic codeword can be obtained by performing the following steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The polynomial $X^{n-k}m(X) = m_0X^{n-k} + m_1X^{n-k+1} + ... +m_{k-1}X^{n-1}$ is formed and divided with the generator polynomial $g(X)$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:XrdividedByGenerator}
X^{n-k}m(X) = q(X)g(X)+p(X)
\end{equation}

\item When reordering equation \ref{eq:XrdividedByGenerator} the following is obtained:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:XrdividedByGeneratorReoreded}
X^{n-k}m(X)+ p(X)=q(X)g(X)
\end{equation}

\item $X^{n-k}m(X)+p(X)$ is a code polynomial since it is a factor of $g(X)$. Furthermore the systematic form is verified by seeing that the term $X^{n-k}m(X)$ is the message vector right-shifted n-k times, and that $p(X)$ is the redundancy polynomial which occupies the lower degree terms of the polynomial expression of the codeword $c(X)$:

{\centering 
$c(X) = p_0 + p_1X + ... + p_{n-k}X^{n-k-1} + m_0X^{n-k} + m_1X^{n-k+1}+...+m_{k-1}X^{n-1}$ \par}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation}
The encoder has been implemented in a Matlab function called  \code{EncodeCyclicSystematic()}, which takes the generator polynomial and message vector as inputs and returns the codeword as output.

The algorithm implemented by the function conforms to the steps described in section \ref{sec:cyclicCodeInSystematicForm}. The code segments shown here display the most important parts of the source code. The complete function can be found in Appendix \ref{App:SourceCode}. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The polynomial $X^{n-k}m(X)$ is formed and divided by $g(X)$:
\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:obtainP},captionpos=b, caption=Obtaining $p(X)$ as the remainder of $X^rm(X) / g(X)$.] 
%creating X^(n-k) = X^r
Xr = zeros(1,length(generatorPoly));   %All zero vector with length = r
Xr(end) = 1;          %Assign 1 to r'th position

%(X^r)m(X)
XrMX = gfconv(Xr, message);

%calculate the remainder(p(X)) of (X^r)m(X) / g(X) 
[qu p] = gfdeconv(XrMX, generatorPoly);
\end{lstlisting}

\item $c(X)$ is obtained by adding  $X^{n-k}m(X)$ and $p(X)$ (step 2 and 3 from previous section)

\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:obtainC},captionpos=b, caption=Obtaining $c(X)$ by adding $X^{n-k}m(X)$ and $p(X)$.]
codeword = mod([ p zeros(1, n - length(p))] + [XrMX zeros(1, n - length(XrMX))], 2);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}



\section{Channel transmission}
The channel transmission has been emulated by adding an error vector $e(X)$ to the encoded vector $c(X)$ and thereby obtaining the received vector $r(X)$. 

\begin{equation}
r(X) = c(X) + e(X)
\end{equation}
