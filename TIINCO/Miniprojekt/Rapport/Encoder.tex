\chapter{Encoder}
An encoder has the task of transforming the message vector into the codeword. In this project the following additional requirements apply to the encoder function:

\begin{itemize}
\item The function has two inputs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Generator polynomial
	\item Message vector
	\end{itemize}
\item The function has one output
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Code vector
	\end{itemize}
\item The code vector must be in systematic form
\end{itemize} 

\section{Cyclic codes in systematic form}
This section explains the theory of constructing cyclic codes in systematic form and is based on \emph{Essentials of Error Control Coding}\cite{essentials} section 3.4

The regular procedure for constructing cyclic codewords is to multiply the message polynomial $m(X)$ with the generator polynomial $g(X)$ to obtain the codeword $c(X)$. However this encoding process produces non-systematic codewords, which is not preferable when implementing a decoder in hardware. Therefore the systematic encoding procedure is introduced.

Given a message polynomial of the form:

{\centering 
$m(X) = m_0 + m_1X + ... + m_{k-1}X^{k-1}$ \par}

the systematic codeword can be obtained by performing the following steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The polynomial $X^{n-k}m(X) = m_0X^{n-k} + m_1X^{n-k+1} + ... +m_{k-1}X^{n-1}$ is formed and divided with the generator polynomial $g(X)$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:XrdividedByGenerator}
X^{n-k}m(X) = q(X)g(X)+p(X)
\end{equation}

\item When reordering equation \ref{eq:XrdividedByGenerator} the following is obtained:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:XrdividedByGeneratorReoreded}
X^{n-k}m(X)+ p(X)=q(X)g(X)
\end{equation}

\item $X^{n-k}m(X)+p(X)$ is a code polynomial since it is a factor of $g(X)$. Furthermore the systematic form is verified by seeing that the term $X^{n-k}m(X)$ is the message vector right-shifted n-k times, and that $p(X)$ is the redundancy polynomial which occupies the lower degree terms of the polynomial expression of the codeword $c(X)$:

{\centering 
$c(X) = p_0 + p_1X + ... + p_{n-k}X^{n-k-1} + m_0X^{n-k} + m_1X^{n-k+1}+...+m_{k-1}X^{n-1}$ \par}

\end{enumerate}
